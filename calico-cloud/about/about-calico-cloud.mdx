- **Automated image scanning and blocking**
    Monitor and assess workloads for new and existing CVEs 24/7.

- **Runtime container threat defense**
    Complete protection against known and zero-day attacks, whether they are network or container-based.

- **Onboarding training and self-service**
    Built-in onboarding in Manager UI, hands-on training from Customer Support during trials so you can see your use cases realized in short order, and self-service workshops and training.

The sweetspot for {{prodname}} is for small teams who need to manage the full spectrum of compliance in a web-based console for novice users.
