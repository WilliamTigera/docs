### Known issues

- L7 log collection fails to deploy on CIS-hardened clusters. As a result, some cards in the manager UI dashboard will not display any metrics.
- Upgrading {{prodname}} v3.15.4 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} v3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
