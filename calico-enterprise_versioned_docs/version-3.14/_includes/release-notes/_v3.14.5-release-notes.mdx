The Tigera Operator version has been updated to v1.27.18.

## Known issues

- Enabling L7 related Anomaly Detection jobs require L7 to be enabled on the cluster. AD job crashloops if L7 is not enabled.
- Upgrading {{prodname}} from v3.12.0 and earlier to v3.14.3 using helm charts is not supported at this time.
- Upgrading {{prodname}} v3.15.4 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} v3.11.0, v3.11.1, v3.11.2, v3.12.0 and v3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for upgrade to proceed.
