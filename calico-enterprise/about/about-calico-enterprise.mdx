# About Calico Enterprise 

## What is {{prodname}}?

{{prodname}} is a paid, self-managed security and observability solution for containers and Kubernetes. {{prodname}} extends Calico Open Source networking and network security capabilities to offer more advanced security and observability capabilities for organizations running Kubernetes at scale.

## Deployment options and support

{{prodname}} is compromised of two decoupled components that offer the widest deployment options across platforms:

- **{{prodname}} CNI** to configure networking resources
- **{{prodname}} network policy** to secure workload and host endpoints

For example, if you use Kubernetes for AWS (self-managed) or EKS (public cloud), you can use either of these options:

- {{prodname}} CNI and {{prodname}} network policy
- AWS VPC CNI with {{prodname}} network policy 

{{prodname}} supports these [platforms and versions](../get-started/kubernetes/getting-started/compatibility.mdx)

## Installation options

You can install {{prodname}} using a single operator/Helm chart.

To start working with {{prodname}} in under 15 minutes, here's a [quickstart guide](../getting-started/kubernetes/quickstart.mdx).
