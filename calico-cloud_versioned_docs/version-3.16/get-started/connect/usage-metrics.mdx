# Get usage metrics

For each customer, {{prodname}} provides unique consumption metrics including amount of node hours and amount of data ingested. You can also download an invoice and export to CSV.

In Manager UI:

1. From the cluster drop-down menu, select your cluster.
1. Click the Profile icon, and select **Usage Metrics**.

## How NodeHours are calculated

`NodeHours` are calculated for a single node by dividing the vCPU of each node by four, rounding up, and then *adding them together*. Because the calculation is on a per-node basis, the results are not the same as adding up all the vCPU and dividing by four. `NodeHours` are updated every hour, and change every month because of the different number of days in a month.

For example, if you install {{prodname}} on a single machine with 32 physical cores (64 cores are presented to the kernel), and if each node only goes up to 4 vCPU, the result is 64 vcpu / 4 = 16 billable nodes.
