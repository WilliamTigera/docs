# Get usage metrics

For each customer, {{prodname}} provides unique consumption metrics including amount of node hours and amount of data ingested. You can also download an invoice and export to CSV.

In Manager UI:

1. From the cluster drop-down menu, select your cluster.
1. Click the Profile icon, and select **Usage Metrics**.

## How NodeHours are calculated to determine NodeHours Cost

`NodeHours` are calculated for a single node by dividing the vCPU of each node by four, round up, and then *add them together*. Note that the results are different from adding up all the vCPU and dividing by four (because it is done on a per-node basis). For example, if you install CC on a single machine with 32 physical cores (and thus, 64 cores presented to the kernel), and if each node only goes up to 4 vCPU, the result is 64 vcpu / 4 = 16 billable nodes.

Also be aware that `NodeHours` will change per month, depending on the number of days in a month.
