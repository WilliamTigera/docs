# Usage and billing

{{prodname}} admins can view metrics on product usage on the **Usage Metrics** page of the UI. On this page, you can view the node hours and ingested data consumed by each managed cluster each month, as well as the cost in node hours and any data overage cost. You can also download an invoice and export to CSV. To view this page:

1. From the cluster drop-down menu, select your cluster.
1. Click the Profile icon, and select **Usage Metrics**.

## How NodeHours Cost is calculated

To calculate **NodeHours**, divide the vCPU of each node by four, round up, and then add them together. (Note this is different from adding up all the vCPU and then dividing by four, because it is done on a per-node basis.)

## How Ingested Data is calculated

{{prodname}} provides users with 200 GB per month of ingested data, which is included in the standard pricing before overage charges are incurred. Additional data usage is charged at a rate of $0.25 / GB / month.
